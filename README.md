### How to run
Just run in a terminal `./gradlew run` in the root folder of this application. To run the tests you can run in a terminal `./gradlew test`

### Improvement suggestions
- Add useful logs to help track possible issues
- Add a code validator to check bad smells, duplicates, test coverage, etc.
- Change the in memory database to a powerful one (for example: postgresql)
- Add a docker file to provide a better way to use a database locally
- Add a validation layer to incoming requests
